# Infrastructure Excellence

> Production-ready infrastructure templates, modules, and best practices from 20+ years of operations.

This repository is a collection of production-ready infrastructure templates, modules, and best practices that I have developed over my 20+ year career in technology leadership. It is designed to help other engineers and leaders build and operate reliable, scalable, and secure infrastructure.

## 🚀 My Approach to Infrastructure

I believe that infrastructure should be treated as a product, not a project. It should be designed, built, and operated with the same level of rigor and discipline as any other software product. My approach is to use a combination of automation, data, and best practices to build infrastructure that is reliable, scalable, secure, and cost-effective.
